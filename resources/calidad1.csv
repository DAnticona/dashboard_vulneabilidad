 A vulnerability exists in SSL communications when clients are allowed to connect
using no authentication algorithm. SSL client-server communication may use several different types of
authentication: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSS or none. When 'none' is used, the
communications are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.""",An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to impersonate your server to clients.,Disable support for anonymous authentication to mitigate this vulnerability.,,,"CIPHER	KEY-EXCHANGE	AUTHENTICATION	MAC	ENCRYPTION(KEY-STRENGTH)	GRADE

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are:

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

QID Detection Logic(Unauthenticated): 
If the Referrer Policy header is not found , checks in response body for meta tag containing tag name as ""referrer"" and one of the above Referrer Policy.",The Referrer-Policy header controls how much referrer information is sent to a site when navigating to it. Absence of Referrer-Policy header can lead to leakage of sensitive information via the referrer header.,"Referrer Policy header improves security by ensuring websites don't leak sensitive information via the referrer header. It's recommended to add secure Referrer Policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach.

SSL session caching is targeted to reduce the overhead of negotiations in recurring SSL connections. SSL sessions can be reused to resume an earlier connection or to establish multiple simultaneous connections. The client suggests an SSL session to be reused by identifying the session with a Session-ID during SSL handshake. If the server finds it appropriate to reuse the session,  then they both proceed to secure communication with already known security parameters.

X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected.

 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are:

A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

QID Detection Logic(Unauthenticated): 
If the Referrer Policy header is not found , checks in response body for meta tag containing tag name as ""referrer"" and one of the above Referrer Policy.",The Referrer-Policy header controls how much referrer information is sent to a site when navigating to it. Absence of Referrer-Policy header can lead to leakage of sensitive information via the referrer header.,"Referrer Policy header improves security by ensuring websites don't leak sensitive information via the referrer header. It's recommended to add secure Referrer Policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach.

The target Web server was found to support this functionality of the HTTP 1.1 protocol.","Support for URL-Request Pipelining has interesting consequences. For example, as explained in this paper by Daniel Roelker (http://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-11/dc-11-presentations/dc-11-Roelker/dc-11-roelker-paper.pdf), it can be used for evading detection by Intrusion Detection Systems.

SSL session caching is targeted to reduce the overhead of negotiations in recurring SSL connections. SSL sessions can be reused to resume an earlier connection or to establish multiple simultaneous connections. The client suggests an SSL session to be reused by identifying the session with a Session-ID during SSL handshake. If the server finds it appropriate to reuse the session,  then they both proceed to secure communication with already known security parameters.

This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
 
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site's domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it's possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
 
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
 
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
 
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
 
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance.","If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, users of the Web server may lose their authentication credentials for the server and/or for the Web applications hosted by the server to an attacker. This may be the case even if the Web applications are not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks due to input validation errors.","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor's documentation.
 
 Apache : Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the 'AddModule' and 'LoadModule' directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request's contents are echoed back.
 
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 

 Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
 In the httpd.conf add or modify:
 
TraceEnable Off
 

 
 Microsoft IIS : Microsoft released URLScan (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608), which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases 'TRACK' to 'TRACE'. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
 
URLScan uses the 'urlscan.ini' configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove 'TRACK', 'TRACE' methods from the 'AllowVerbs' section and add them to the 'DenyVerbs' section. With this, URLScan will disallow all 'TRACE' and 'TRACK' methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' from the 'Services' Control Panel item.

TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  
 
The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.
 
This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.
 
This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.
 
There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.
 
Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.
 
It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.",Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.,"Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected. If that port number is known to be used for port-forwarding, then it is the backend host that is really vulnerable.

Affected Versions: 
Versions prior to PHP 5.5.2", Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack and gain unauthorized access to user session.,"Upgrade to PHP version 5.5.2 or above. For more details about PHP releases and patches please visit PHP Homepage (http://www.php.net/). Additionally, customers may want to follow the following guidelines that would prevent such session fixation vulnerabilities:
 - Implement the session.use_strict_mod php.ini directive which when enabled, discards uninitialized session IDs.
 - Implement the session.safe_session_cookie directive that deletes possible malicious cookies, effectively preventing crafted session IDs.
 - Implement the session.use_trans_sid directive that prevents PHP applications from exposing the session identifier in a URL.
 - Implement the session.use_only_cookies php.ini directive that directs PHP to never use URLs with session identifiers.
 
However, customers are advised to test their applications after applying these guidelines as they may affect application behaviour in certain cases.

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. 

OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. 

In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt. 

Affected Versions: 
OpenSSL 1.1.1 a-OpenSSL 1.1.1 c
OpenSSL 1.1.0 a-OpenSSL 1.1.0 k
OpenSSL 1.0.2 a-OpenSSL 1.0.2 s

The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. 
This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. 
In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. 
In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error. 
This issue does not affect OpenSSL 1.1.0.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

Typically the timestamp used is the host's uptime (since last reboot) in various units (e.g., one hundredth of second, one tenth of a second, etc.). Based on this, we can obtain the host's uptime. The result is given in the Result section below.

RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security. 

A POODLE-type (https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2014/12/08/poodle-bites-tls) attack could also be launched directly at TLS without negotiating a downgrade.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
 Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
 Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers. This is a known issue and it is recommend to contact the vendor for a solution.",,,"X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors HTTP Headers missing on port 8443.

A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems.  
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
 
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
 
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
  
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
 
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The Duration is the period of time it takes the service to perform a scan task. The Duration includes the time it takes the service to scan all hosts, which may involve parallel scanning. It also includes the time it takes for a scanner appliance to pick up the scan task and transfer the results back to the service's Secure Operating Center. Further, when a scan task is distributed across multiple scanners, the Duration includes the time it takes to perform parallel host scanning on all scanners.

QID Detection Logic(Unauthenticated): 
If the Referrer Policy header is not found , checks in response body for meta tag containing tag name as ""referrer"" and one of the above Referrer Policy.",The Referrer-Policy header controls how much referrer information is sent to a site when navigating to it. Absence of Referrer-Policy header can lead to leakage of sensitive information via the referrer header.,"Referrer Policy header improves security by ensuring websites don't leak sensitive information via the referrer header. It's recommended to add secure Referrer Policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach.

This means that instead of using the ""Keep-Alive"" method to keep the TCP connection alive over multiple requests, the protocol allows multiple HTTP URL requests to be made in the same TCP packet. Any Web server which is HTTP 1.1 compliant should then process all the URLs requested in the single TCP packet and respond as usual.
 
The target Web server was found to support this functionality of the HTTP 1.1 protocol.","Support for URL-Request Pipelining has interesting consequences. For example, as explained in this paper by Daniel Roelker (http://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-11/dc-11-presentations/dc-11-Roelker/dc-11-roelker-paper.pdf), it can be used for evading detection by Intrusion Detection Systems.

TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  
 
The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.
 
This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.
 
This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.
 
There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.
 
Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.
 
It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.",Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.,"Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected. If that port number is known to be used for port-forwarding, then it is the backend host that is really vulnerable.

The rpc.statd server is an RPC server that implements the Network Status and Monitor RPC protocol. It's a component of the Network File System (NFS) architecture. 
 
rpc.statd contains a format string vulnerability when calling the syslog() function. This vulnerability allows remote users to execute code as root. The logging code in rpc.statd uses the syslog() function to pass user-supplied data as the format string. A malicious user can construct a format string that injects executable code into the process address space and overwrites a function's return address, forcing the program to execute the code.
 
rpc.statd requires root privileges for opening it's network socket, but fails to drop these privileges later on. Therefore, code injected by the malicious user will execute with root privileges.
 
Debian, Red Hat and Connectiva have all released advisories on this matter. Presumably, any Linux distribution that runs the statd process is vulnerable, unless already patched for the problem.","If successfully exploited, unauthorized users can execute remote commands as root.","For Red Hat Linux:
Upgrade to the latest version of nfs-utils (0.1.9.1 or later), as listed in RHSA-2000:043-03 (https://www.redhat.com/archives/redhat-watch-list/2000-September/msg00001.html).
 
For Debian Linux:
Upgrade to the latest version of nfs-utils (0.1.9.1 or later), as listed in Debian Security Advisory 20000719a (http://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000719a).

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

Encryption in SSL 3.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases, and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

The SSLv3 protocol is insecure due to the POODLE attack and the weakness of RC4 cipher. 
Note: In April 2016, PCI released PCI DSS v3.2 (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2.pdf) announcing that NIST no longer considers Secure Socket Layers (SSL) v3.0 protocol as acceptable for protecting data and that all versions of SSL versions do not meet the PCI definition of ""strong cryptography.""

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

They provide these services by using encryption for privacy, x509 certificates for authenticity and one-way hash functions for integrity. To encrypt data SSL and TLS can use block ciphers, which are encryption algorithms that can encrypt only a fixed block of original data to an encrypted block of the same size. Note that these ciphers will always obtain the same resulting block for the same original block of data. To achieve a difference in the output the output of encryption is XORed with yet another block of the same size referred to as initialization vectors (IV). A special mode of operation for block ciphers known as CBC (cipher block chaining) uses one IV for the initial block and the result of the previous block for each subsequent block to obtain difference in the output of block cipher encryption.
 
In SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 implementation the choice CBC mode usage was poor because the entire traffic shares one CBC session with a single set of initial IVs. The rest of the IV are as mentioned above results of the encryption of the previous blocks. The subsequent IV is available to the eavesdroppers. This allows an attacker with the capability to inject arbitrary traffic into the plain-text stream (to be encrypted by the client) to verify their guess of the plain-text preceding the injected block. If the attackers guess is correct then the output of the encryption will be the same for two blocks.
 For low entropy data it is possible to guess the plain-text block with relatively few number of attempts. For example for data that has 1000 possibilities the number of attempts can be 500.

 NOTE: 
The CVSS access complexity assigned by NIST to CVE-2011-3389 is 'Medium' which makes the base score 4.3. But Qualys has assigned access complexity to 'High' for the server side, because Javascript injection and MiTM capabilities and a vulnerable client are required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore the Qualys CVSS score is 2.6.",Recently attacks against the web authentication cookies have been described which used this vulnerability. If the authentication cookie is guessed by the attacker then the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user on the Web site which accepts the authentication cookie.,"This attack was identified in 2004 and later revisions of TLS protocol which contain a fix for this. If possible, upgrade to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. If upgrading to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 is not possible, then disabling CBC mode ciphers will remove the vulnerability.
 
Setting your SSL server to prioritize RC4 ciphers mitigates this vulnerability. Microsoft has posted information including workarounds for IIS at KB2588513 (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2588513).
 
Using the following SSL configuration in Apache mitigates this vulnerability:

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL session caching is targeted to reduce the overhead of negotiations in recurring SSL connections. SSL sessions can be reused to resume an earlier connection or to establish multiple simultaneous connections. The client suggests an SSL session to be reused by identifying the session with a Session-ID during SSL handshake. If the server finds it appropriate to reuse the session,  then they both proceed to secure communication with already known security parameters.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

For example if TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

They provide these services by using encryption for privacy, x509 certificates for authenticity and one-way hash functions for integrity. To encrypt data SSL and TLS can use block ciphers, which are encryption algorithms that can encrypt only a fixed block of original data to an encrypted block of the same size. Note that these ciphers will always obtain the same resulting block for the same original block of data. To achieve a difference in the output the output of encryption is XORed with yet another block of the same size referred to as initialization vectors (IV). A special mode of operation for block ciphers known as CBC (cipher block chaining) uses one IV for the initial block and the result of the previous block for each subsequent block to obtain difference in the output of block cipher encryption.
 
In SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 implementation the choice CBC mode usage was poor because the entire traffic shares one CBC session with a single set of initial IVs. The rest of the IV are as mentioned above results of the encryption of the previous blocks. The subsequent IV is available to the eavesdroppers. This allows an attacker with the capability to inject arbitrary traffic into the plain-text stream (to be encrypted by the client) to verify their guess of the plain-text preceding the injected block. If the attackers guess is correct then the output of the encryption will be the same for two blocks.
 For low entropy data it is possible to guess the plain-text block with relatively few number of attempts. For example for data that has 1000 possibilities the number of attempts can be 500.

 NOTE: 
The CVSS access complexity assigned by NIST to CVE-2011-3389 is 'Medium' which makes the base score 4.3. But Qualys has assigned access complexity to 'High' for the server side, because Javascript injection and MiTM capabilities and a vulnerable client are required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore the Qualys CVSS score is 2.6.",Recently attacks against the web authentication cookies have been described which used this vulnerability. If the authentication cookie is guessed by the attacker then the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user on the Web site which accepts the authentication cookie.,"This attack was identified in 2004 and later revisions of TLS protocol which contain a fix for this. If possible, upgrade to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. If upgrading to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 is not possible, then disabling CBC mode ciphers will remove the vulnerability.
 
Setting your SSL server to prioritize RC4 ciphers mitigates this vulnerability. Microsoft has posted information including workarounds for IIS at KB2588513 (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2588513).
 
Using the following SSL configuration in Apache mitigates this vulnerability:

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.
 
Some operating systems (e.g., MacOS, OpenBSD) use a non-zero, probably random, initial value for the timestamp.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

They provide these services by using encryption for privacy, x509 certificates for authenticity and one-way hash functions for integrity. To encrypt data SSL and TLS can use block ciphers, which are encryption algorithms that can encrypt only a fixed block of original data to an encrypted block of the same size. Note that these ciphers will always obtain the same resulting block for the same original block of data. To achieve a difference in the output the output of encryption is XORed with yet another block of the same size referred to as initialization vectors (IV). A special mode of operation for block ciphers known as CBC (cipher block chaining) uses one IV for the initial block and the result of the previous block for each subsequent block to obtain difference in the output of block cipher encryption.
 
In SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 implementation the choice CBC mode usage was poor because the entire traffic shares one CBC session with a single set of initial IVs. The rest of the IV are as mentioned above results of the encryption of the previous blocks. The subsequent IV is available to the eavesdroppers. This allows an attacker with the capability to inject arbitrary traffic into the plain-text stream (to be encrypted by the client) to verify their guess of the plain-text preceding the injected block. If the attackers guess is correct then the output of the encryption will be the same for two blocks.
 For low entropy data it is possible to guess the plain-text block with relatively few number of attempts. For example for data that has 1000 possibilities the number of attempts can be 500.

 NOTE: 
The CVSS access complexity assigned by NIST to CVE-2011-3389 is 'Medium' which makes the base score 4.3. But Qualys has assigned access complexity to 'High' for the server side, because Javascript injection and MiTM capabilities and a vulnerable client are required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore the Qualys CVSS score is 2.6.",Recently attacks against the web authentication cookies have been described which used this vulnerability. If the authentication cookie is guessed by the attacker then the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user on the Web site which accepts the authentication cookie.,"This attack was identified in 2004 and later revisions of TLS protocol which contain a fix for this. If possible, upgrade to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. If upgrading to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 is not possible, then disabling CBC mode ciphers will remove the vulnerability.
 
Setting your SSL server to prioritize RC4 ciphers mitigates this vulnerability. Microsoft has posted information including workarounds for IIS at KB2588513 (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2588513).

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
 Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers. This is a known issue and it is recommend to contact the vendor for a solution.",,,"X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors HTTP Headers missing on port 8080.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
 Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers. This is a known issue and it is recommend to contact the vendor for a solution.",,,"X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors HTTP Headers missing on port 8443.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.
 
Some operating systems (e.g., MacOS, OpenBSD) use a non-zero, probably random, initial value for the timestamp. For these operating systems, the uptime obtained does not reflect the actual uptime of the host; the former is always larger than the latter.",N/A,N/A,,,"Based on TCP timestamps obtained via port 22, the host's uptime is 3 days, 5 hours, and 5 minutes.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
 Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers.

Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data. TLS protocol was extended to cryptographically tierenegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over. This is referred to as TLS secure renegotiation extension.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

For example if TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

CVE-2016-6662- A vulnerability exists in the mysqld_safe script which is used by many default installations/packages of MySQL as a wrapper to start the MySQL service process. This script is executed with root privileges and the main mysqld process lowers its privilege level to mysql user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a path to their malicious library within the config, pre-loading an arbitrary library and executing arbitrary code with root privileges when MySQL service is restarted. 
CVE-2016-6663/CVE-2016-5616- A race condition was found in the way MySQL performed MyISAM engine table repair. A database user with shell access to the server running mysqld could use this flaw to change permissions of arbitrary files writable by the mysql system user. 
CVE-2016-6664/CVE-2016-5617- A flaw was found in the way the mysqld_safe script handled creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. 
Affected Versions: 
Oracle MySQL versions prior to 5.7.15, 5.6.33 and 5.5.52","Successful exploitation could allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on which an affected version of MySQL is running.","MySQL releases following security fixes: MySQL 5.5.52 (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-52.html) MySQL 5.6.33 (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-33.html) MySQL 5.7.15 (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-15.html)
 





Workaround: 
As a temporary workaround, administrators are advised to ensure that no mysql config files are owned by mysql users. They are also advised to create root-owned dummy my.cnf files if not in use.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

If the Referrer Policy header is not found , checks in response body for meta tag containing tag name as ""referrer"" and one of the above Referrer Policy.",The Referrer-Policy header controls how much referrer information is sent to a site when navigating to it. Absence of Referrer-Policy header can lead to leakage of sensitive information via the referrer header.,"Referrer Policy header improves security by ensuring websites don't leak sensitive information via the referrer header. It's recommended to add secure Referrer Policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach.

This means that instead of using the ""Keep-Alive"" method to keep the TCP connection alive over multiple requests, the protocol allows multiple HTTP URL requests to be made in the same TCP packet.

The target Web server was found to support this functionality of the HTTP 1.1 protocol.","Support for URL-Request Pipelining has interesting consequences. For example, as explained in this paper by Daniel Roelker (http://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-11/dc-11-presentations/dc-11-Roelker/dc-11-roelker-paper.pdf), it can be used for evading detection by Intrusion Detection Systems.

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2 before 4.2.0.CP09;4.3 before 4.3.0.CP08; 5.0, 5.1.1, 5.1.0, 5 EL4, 5 EL5 and 5 EL6 are affected.",Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass the authentication and allows unauthorized disclosure of information.,"The vendor has released patches to resolve this issue. Refer to Red Hat Bug 585899 (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=585899) to address this issue and obtain further details.
 
For securing the JMX Console and the Web Console, refer to SecureTheJmxConsole (http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SecureTheJmxConsole). The link has information on protecting against the vulnerability for CVE-2010-0738.

It acts as a ""gateway"" for clients wanting to connect to any RPC daemon. 
 
When the portmapper/rpcbind is removed or firewalled, standard RPC client programs fail to obtain the portmapper list.  However, by sending carefully crafted packets, it's possible to determine which RPC programs are listening on which port. This technique is known as direct RPC scanning. It's used to bypass portmapper/rpcbind in order to find RPC programs running on a port (TCP or UDP ports). On Linux servers, RPC services are typically listening on privileged ports (below 1024), whereas on Solaris, RPC services are on temporary ports (starting with port 32700).","Unauthorized users can build a list of RPC services running on the host.

172.19.244.32,bmesrvc34.domibco.com.pe,,Linux 2.x,"host scanned, found vuln",82054,TCP Sequence Number Approximation Based Denial of Service,Vuln,1,,,,,CVE-2004-0230,,10183,5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P),4.3 (E:F/RL:TF/RC:C),,,"TCP provides stateful communications between hosts on a network. TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  
 
The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.
 
This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.
 
This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.
 
There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.
 
Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.
 
It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.",Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.,"Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected. If that port number is known to be used for port-forwarding, then it is the backend host that is really vulnerable.
 
Various implementations and products including Check Point, Cisco, Cray Inc, Hitachi, Internet Initiative Japan, Inc (IIJ), Juniper Networks, NEC, Polycom, and Yamaha are currently undergoing review. Contact the vendors to obtain more information about affected products and fixes.

The rpc.statd server is an RPC server that implements the Network Status and Monitor RPC protocol. It's a component of the Network File System (NFS) architecture. 
 
rpc.statd contains a format string vulnerability when calling the syslog() function. This vulnerability allows remote users to execute code as root. The logging code in rpc.statd uses the syslog() function to pass user-supplied data as the format string. A malicious user can construct a format string that injects executable code into the process address space and overwrites a function's return address, forcing the program to execute the code.
 
rpc.statd requires root privileges for opening it's network socket, but fails to drop these privileges later on. Therefore, code injected by the malicious user will execute with root privileges.
 
Debian, Red Hat and Connectiva have all released advisories on this matter. Presumably, any Linux distribution that runs the statd process is vulnerable, unless already patched for the problem.","If successfully exploited, unauthorized users can execute remote commands as root.","For Red Hat Linux:

172.19.244.32,bmesrvc34.domibco.com.pe,,Linux 2.x,"host scanned, found vuln",45017,Operating System Detected,Ig,2,,,,,,,,,,,,"Several different techniques can be used to identify the operating system (OS) running on a host. A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a website tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options:

nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block"");

This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
 
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site's domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it's possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
 
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
 
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
 
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
 
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance.","If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, users of the Web server may lose their authentication credentials for the server and/or for the Web applications hosted by the server to an attacker. This may be the case even if the Web applications are not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks due to input validation errors.","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor's documentation.
 
 Apache : Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the 'AddModule' and 'LoadModule' directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request's contents are echoed back.
 
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 

 Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
 In the httpd.conf add or modify:
 
TraceEnable Off
 

 
 Microsoft IIS : Microsoft released URLScan (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608), which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases 'TRACK' to 'TRACE'. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
 
URLScan uses the 'urlscan.ini' configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove 'TRACK', 'TRACE' methods from the 'AllowVerbs' section and add them to the 'DenyVerbs' section. With this, URLScan will disallow all 'TRACE' and 'TRACK' methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' from the 'Services' Control Panel item.

X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload]

CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN

X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;

This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
 
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site's domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it's possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
 
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
 
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
 
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
 
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance.","If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, users of the Web server may lose their authentication credentials for the server and/or for the Web applications hosted by the server to an attacker. This may be the case even if the Web applications are not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks due to input validation errors.","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor's documentation.
 
 Apache : Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the 'AddModule' and 'LoadModule' directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request's contents are echoed back.
 
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 

 Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
 In the httpd.conf add or modify:
 
TraceEnable Off
 

 
 Microsoft IIS : Microsoft released URLScan (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608), which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases 'TRACK' to 'TRACE'. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
 
URLScan uses the 'urlscan.ini' configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove 'TRACK', 'TRACE' methods from the 'AllowVerbs' section and add them to the 'DenyVerbs' section. With this, URLScan will disallow all 'TRACE' and 'TRACK' methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' from the 'Services' Control Panel item.

-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
  
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers.

If the server finds it appropriate to reuse the session,  then they both proceed to secure communication with already known security parameters.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

SMB signing is a security mechanism in the SMB protocol and is also known as security signatures. SMB signing is designed to help improve the security of the SMB protocol.
 
SMB signing adds security to a network using NetBIOS, avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
When SMB signing is enabled on both the client and server SMB sessions are authenticated between the machines on a packet by packet basis. 

QID Detection Logic: 
This checks from the registry value of RequireSecuritySignature and EnableSecuritySignature form  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkStation\Parameters for client  and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSetServices\LanmanServer\Parameters for servers to check if SMB signing is required or enabled or disabled. 

Note: On 5/28/2020 the QID was updated to check for client SMB signing behavior via the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SystemCurrent\ControlSetServices\LanmanWorkStation\Parameters. The complete detection logic is explained above.","Unauthorized users sniffing the network could catch many challenge/response exchanges and replay the whole thing to grab particular session keys, and then authenticate on the Domain Controller.","Without SMB signing, a device could intercept SMB network packets from an originating computer, alter their contents, and broadcast them to the destination computer. Since, digitally signing the packets enables the recipient of the packets to confirm their point of origination and their authenticity, it is recommended that SMB signing is enabled and required.
 
Please refer to Microsoft's article 887429 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887429) and The Basics of SMB Signing (covering both SMB1 and SMB2) (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/josebda/the-basics-of-smb-signing-covering-both-smb1-and-smb2)  for information on enabling SMB signing. 
 
For Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, please refer to Microsoft's article Require SMB Security Signatures (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731957.aspx) for information on enabling SMB signing.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  
 
The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.
 
This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.
 
This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.
 
There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.
 
Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.
 
It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.",Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.,"Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected. If that port number is known to be used for port-forwarding, then it is the backend host that is really vulnerable.

The rpc.statd server is an RPC server that implements the Network Status and Monitor RPC protocol. It's a component of the Network File System (NFS) architecture. 
 
rpc.statd contains a format string vulnerability when calling the syslog() function. This vulnerability allows remote users to execute code as root. The logging code in rpc.statd uses the syslog() function to pass user-supplied data as the format string. A malicious user can construct a format string that injects executable code into the process address space and overwrites a function's return address, forcing the program to execute the code.
 
rpc.statd requires root privileges for opening it's network socket, but fails to drop these privileges later on. Therefore, code injected by the malicious user will execute with root privileges.
 
Debian, Red Hat and Connectiva have all released advisories on this matter. Presumably, any Linux distribution that runs the statd process is vulnerable, unless already patched for the problem.","If successfully exploited, unauthorized users can execute remote commands as root.","For Red Hat Linux:

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

SMB signing is a security mechanism in the SMB protocol and is also known as security signatures. SMB signing is designed to help improve the security of the SMB protocol.
 
SMB signing adds security to a network using NetBIOS, avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
When SMB signing is enabled on both the client and server SMB sessions are authenticated between the machines on a packet by packet basis. 

QID Detection Logic: 
This checks from the registry value of RequireSecuritySignature and EnableSecuritySignature form  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkStation\Parameters for client  and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSetServices\LanmanServer\Parameters for servers to check if SMB signing is required or enabled or disabled.

The complete detection logic is explained above.","Unauthorized users sniffing the network could catch many challenge/response exchanges and replay the whole thing to grab particular session keys, and then authenticate on the Domain Controller.","Without SMB signing, a device could intercept SMB network packets from an originating computer, alter their contents, and broadcast them to the destination computer. Since, digitally signing the packets enables the recipient of the packets to confirm their point of origination and their authenticity, it is recommended that SMB signing is enabled and required.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

SMB signing is a security mechanism in the SMB protocol and is also known as security signatures. SMB signing is designed to help improve the security of the SMB protocol.
 
SMB signing adds security to a network using NetBIOS, avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
When SMB signing is enabled on both the client and server SMB sessions are authenticated between the machines on a packet by packet basis. 

QID Detection Logic: 
This checks from the registry value of RequireSecuritySignature and EnableSecuritySignature form  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkStation\Parameters for client  and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSetServices\LanmanServer\Parameters for servers to check if SMB signing is required or enabled or disabled. 

Note: On 5/28/2020 the QID was updated to check for client SMB signing behavior via the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SystemCurrent\ControlSetServices\LanmanWorkStation\Parameters. The complete detection logic is explained above.","Unauthorized users sniffing the network could catch many challenge/response exchanges and replay the whole thing to grab particular session keys, and then authenticate on the Domain Controller.","Without SMB signing, a device could intercept SMB network packets from an originating computer, alter their contents, and broadcast them to the destination computer. Since, digitally signing the packets enables the recipient of the packets to confirm their point of origination and their authenticity, it is recommended that SMB signing is enabled and required.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

For example if TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

They provide these services by using encryption for privacy, x509 certificates for authenticity and one-way hash functions for integrity. To encrypt data SSL and TLS can use block ciphers, which are encryption algorithms that can encrypt only a fixed block of original data to an encrypted block of the same size. Note that these ciphers will always obtain the same resulting block for the same original block of data. To achieve a difference in the output the output of encryption is XORed with yet another block of the same size referred to as initialization vectors (IV). A special mode of operation for block ciphers known as CBC (cipher block chaining) uses one IV for the initial block and the result of the previous block for each subsequent block to obtain difference in the output of block cipher encryption.
 
In SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 implementation the choice CBC mode usage was poor because the entire traffic shares one CBC session with a single set of initial IVs. The rest of the IV are as mentioned above results of the encryption of the previous blocks. The subsequent IV is available to the eavesdroppers. This allows an attacker with the capability to inject arbitrary traffic into the plain-text stream (to be encrypted by the client) to verify their guess of the plain-text preceding the injected block. If the attackers guess is correct then the output of the encryption will be the same for two blocks.
 For low entropy data it is possible to guess the plain-text block with relatively few number of attempts. For example for data that has 1000 possibilities the number of attempts can be 500.

 NOTE: 
The CVSS access complexity assigned by NIST to CVE-2011-3389 is 'Medium' which makes the base score 4.3. But Qualys has assigned access complexity to 'High' for the server side, because Javascript injection and MiTM capabilities and a vulnerable client are required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore the Qualys CVSS score is 2.6.",Recently attacks against the web authentication cookies have been described which used this vulnerability. If the authentication cookie is guessed by the attacker then the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user on the Web site which accepts the authentication cookie.,"This attack was identified in 2004 and later revisions of TLS protocol which contain a fix for this. If possible, upgrade to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. If upgrading to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 is not possible, then disabling CBC mode ciphers will remove the vulnerability.
 
Setting your SSL server to prioritize RC4 ciphers mitigates this vulnerability. Microsoft has posted information including workarounds for IIS at KB2588513 (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2588513).
 
Using the following SSL configuration in Apache mitigates this vulnerability:

Qualys SSL/TLS Deployment Best Practices can be found here (https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/best-practices/).

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach.

It acts as a ""gateway"" for clients wanting to connect to any RPC daemon. 
 
When the portmapper/rpcbind is removed or firewalled, standard RPC client programs fail to obtain the portmapper list.  However, by sending carefully crafted packets, it's possible to determine which RPC programs are listening on which port. This technique is known as direct RPC scanning. It's used to bypass portmapper/rpcbind in order to find RPC programs running on a port (TCP or UDP ports). On Linux servers, RPC services are typically listening on privileged ports (below 1024), whereas on Solaris, RPC services are on temporary ports (starting with port 32700).","Unauthorized users can build a list of RPC services running on the host.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.
